# Chomsky Font

To use the Chomsky font in this project:

1. Download the Chomsky font from [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chomsky) or another reputable source
2. Place the font files in this directory (`public/fonts/`):
   - `Chomsky.otf` or `Chomsky.ttf` (for regular weight)
   - `Chomsky-Bold.otf` or `Chomsky-Bold.ttf` (for bold weight)

The font is already configured in `app/globals.css` with `@font-face` declarations.
